    // overloaded member functions
    /* A static member function is independent of any object of the class.
    A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist.
    A static member function can also be accessed using the class name through the scope resolution operator.
    A static member function can access static data members and static member functions inside or outside of the class.
    Static member functions have a scope inside the class and cannot access the current object pointer.
You can also use a static member function to determine how many objects of the class have been created.
    The reason we need Static member function:
    Static members are frequently used to store information that is shared by all objects in a class.
    For instance, you may keep track of the quantity of newly generated objects of a specific class type using a static data member as a counter. This static data member can be increased each time an object is generated to keep track of the overall number of objects. */
